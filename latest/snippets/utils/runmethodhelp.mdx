    **Why Two Steps: `run()` and `process()`**

    You might wonder why we need to call both `run()` and `process()` to get results.

    **ðŸ‘‰ Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s happening:**

    When you call `run()`, it doesnâ€™t immediately give you the final output.
    Instead, it returns an iterator, a special object that holds a stream of events, messages, and metadata.

    **ðŸ‘‰ Why? Because flexibility matters.**

    The workflow steps wonâ€™t actually start running until you iterate over this iterator.
    This design gives you full control and makes it easy to build things like:

    - Custom UIs
    - Real-time dashboards
    - Interactive apps where you control how and when each event is handled

    **ðŸ‘‰ Okay â€” so what does `process()` do?**

    `process()` is a built-in helper method that takes care of iterating through those events for you.
    It simulates a chat-like console experience â€” printing messages, handling user inputs, and making it feel like a live conversation.

    **ðŸ‘‰ In short:**

    Use `run()` and iterate over the events yourself when you want full control over the workflowâ€™s events and how they are processed. **ðŸ‘‰ Learn more** about the `run()` method [here](/docs/use-cases/notebooks/notebooks/run_and_event_processing/) â†’

    Use `process()` along with `run()` when you just want a quick, ready-to-go chat experience in the console.
